SYSTEM PROMPT FOR REPLIT AI (COPY–PASTE AS IS):

You are building a production-ready web application for a college tech competition called VIBEATHON – Round 2: Logic Lock.

This is a high-stakes elimination round, not a tutorial platform.

1️⃣ CORE GAME OBJECTIVE

Players must solve a coding logic challenge by arranging shuffled code blocks using drag-and-drop.

Only the correct blocks in the correct order result in success.

Any imposter block or wrong order results in failure.

2️⃣ VISUAL THEME & UX (MANDATORY)

Design the UI inspired by Squid Game × Stranger Things:

Dark background (black / deep blue)

Red neon accents

Retro-digital countdown fonts

Glitch / flicker effects for tension

Minimal hints, high pressure

This must feel like a survival game, not a learning app.

3️⃣ ROLES & ACCESS CONTROL

Implement three strictly separated roles:

👤 Player
👨‍⚖️ Judge
👑 Admin

No role can access another role’s privileges.

4️⃣ PLAYER ID SYSTEM (MANDATORY)

Each player must enter a Player ID before starting.

Format: VB-R2-###

Player ID is:

Locked after entry

Visible on screen at all times

Refreshing the page must NOT reset Player ID or game state.

Player ID must track:

Language chosen

Difficulty chosen

Drag usage

Cooldowns

Run count

Time remaining

Final status (Playing / Qualified / Eliminated)

5️⃣ JUDGE ID SYSTEM

Judges log in using JUDGE-##

Judges see a read-only live dashboard

Judge dashboard must show:

| Player ID | Language | Difficulty | Drags Left | Time Left | Runs Used | Status |

Status colors:

🟢 Playing

🟡 Cooldown

🔴 Eliminated

🟣 Qualified

Judges must NEVER see:

Correct solution

Code correctness details

6️⃣ ADMIN ID SYSTEM (NO LOOPHOLES)

Admin logs in using ADMIN-01.

Admin abilities:

Add / edit / delete coding problems

Add / remove code blocks

Mark blocks as correct or imposter

Reorder correct blocks (admin-side only)

Enable or disable problems

Select the active problem for the round

Start / end round

Lock all player screens

Once a round starts:

Admin CANNOT modify code blocks

Admin CANNOT modify drag limits

7️⃣ CODE & BLOCK MANAGEMENT

Each problem must include:

Language (Python / Java / C++)

Difficulty (Easy / Medium / Hard)

Correct code blocks (ordered)

Imposter code blocks

Players must see:

Only shuffled blocks

No indication of correct vs imposter

8️⃣ GAME LAYOUT
Left Panel: DROP ZONE

Empty area where players place chosen blocks

Only this area is evaluated

Right Panel: CODE POOL

All shuffled blocks (correct + imposter)

9️⃣ DYNAMIC DRAG LIMIT SYSTEM (CRITICAL)

Drag limit must be calculated automatically:

Base Drags = (Number of Correct Code Blocks × 2)


Difficulty bonus:

Easy → +2

Medium → +5

Hard → +8

Total Drags = Base Drags + Difficulty Bonus


Each drag reduces count

When drags reach 0:

Dragging is disabled

Each extra drag attempt triggers a 10-second cooldown

🔟 RUN SYSTEM

Players can click Run ▶

Constraints:

Max 3 runs per minute

Each run has a 30-second execution timeout

Run silently checks logic correctness

No hints or partial feedback

1️⃣1️⃣ SUBMIT SYSTEM

Submit enabled only after at least one Run

On submit:

Correct → QUALIFIED

Incorrect → ELIMINATED

After submit:

UI locked permanently

1️⃣2️⃣ TIMER & ELIMINATION

Global round timer (e.g., 3 minutes)

Timer always visible

When timer ends:

Player is eliminated

Screen locks

1️⃣3️⃣ SECURITY & ANTI-CHEAT

Language & difficulty locked after selection

Page refresh does NOT reset state

No undo after submit

No access to other players’ data

Judge dashboard is read-only

1️⃣4️⃣ VISUAL STATES

QUALIFIED:

Green glow

Calm animation

ELIMINATED:

Red overlay

UI disabled

1️⃣5️⃣ TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

Frontend must be modular and readable

Use drag-and-drop

Maintain persistent state (local storage or backend)

Must be deployable directly from Replit

⚠️ ABSOLUTE RULES (NO EXCEPTIONS)

Do NOT expose correct solution

Do NOT give hints

Do NOT allow retries after submission

Do NOT simplify rules

Build the complete, fully working system exactly as described above.
